WRIte haVEN

Writing is always a hard work. Well, may be not as hard as working in a mine, but sometimes it is complicated in a way hard to explain if you never felt it.

Writing is not new. There are tons of writers along the history (literally) and all of them must handle two kind of problems: creative and technical.

Creative problems are out of the scope, but technical are our delight. No ink, papyrus or typewriters are problems of today... but computers are complex. If you lived in the 19th century and your masterwork is about one thousand handwritten pages to see those pages get lost, burnt or dog-eaten could be the fabric of your worst nightmares. But if you live today something as stupid as a power fault, a disk corruption or just the computer-gnomes can turn your novel into a lot of unmeaningfull bits.

This project aims to cover this need.

What *wriven* is for?
---------------------

When you run an instance of *wriven* in a hardware (pc, sbc, mobile, etc...) it turns into a haven for the things that you write. The idea is to run a bunch of different wriven servers (locally or remotely) that will comunicate with each other replicating and controlling the contents of their storages.

As a starting point, *wriven* will only work with text files (real writers use ms-word?).

The *wriven's* network will act as a "multi-agent" system.
